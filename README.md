**Testing conditions of water wells in Tanzania to determine the safety of the wells drinking water**

## Overview
This project aims to assess the conditions of water wells in Tanzania to determine the safety of the drinking water they provide. The main approach is to analyze relevant data and build a predictive logistic regression model to identify whether a water well is functioning well or not. 
By understanding the contributing features to the functionality of the wells, this project can assist in ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water for communities in Tanzania. This is also so Tanzaniaâ€™s Ministry of Water can utilize their resources to repair and maintain the water wells that have the highest likelihood of being in need of repair.

**This is an important project because Tanzania is in the midst of a water crisis:**
4 million people in the country do not have access to a source of safe drinking water and 30 million people lack access to improved water sanitation. 
A better understanding of which features might be contributing to water pumps functionality could possibly help ensure that clean water becomes available to more people across the country.

## Background
Access to clean and safe drinking water is crucial for the well-being and health of any community. In Tanzania, many communities rely on water wells as their primary source of drinking water. However, the functionality and safety of these wells can vary, and it is essential to identify which wells are functioning well and providing safe water.

**This project aims to address the following questions:**

- How can we determine if a water well in Tanzania is functioning well or not?

- What features and factors contribute to the functionality and safety of water wells in Tanzania?

- Can we build a predictive model to assess the safety of a water well based on available data?



## Data
The project utilizes a dataset that includes information about various water wells in Tanzania. 

This data set is derived from drivendata.org, and the data in the dataset contains information from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.

**This data set contains over 59,000 data points and several features, including but not limited to:**

- Geographical location (latitude and longitude) of the wells.

- Water quality parameters (e.g., pH, turbidity, presence of contaminants).

- Well construction details (e.g., depth, type, and age of the well).

- Pump functionality information (whether the pump is operational or not).

- Groundwater level and rainfall patterns.

The dataset is available in the data directory of this project.



## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identifying potential patterns or trends.

**Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the functionality and safety of the water wells.

**Model Building:** Using logistic regression, a predictive model will be trained using the selected features to predict the functionality of water wells as a binary outcome (functioning well or not).

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the logistic regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

**Interpretation:** Interpreting the model results to understand the factors that most influence the functionality and safety of water wells.



## Results
The final output of this project will be a well-trained logistic regression model capable of predicting the functionality of water wells in Tanzania based on relevant features. Additionally, there will be visualizations and insights from the EDA that shed light on factors influencing well conditions.
